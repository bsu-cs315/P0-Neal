## Project Report

### Reflection
&emsp;&emsp;This being a beginning tutorial of Godot engine, I only had one or two minor hiccups finding certain options in the Godot GUI, but there were a couple features used in the tutorial that I think will be useful moving forward. I learned about setting keybinds in the project settings; that is something easy to implement that I must have missed in the past. I also enjoyed the enemy sprite randomization, for instead of making three different scenes for three different types of enemies, we made one enemy with three different animations, thus avoiding redundant effort. This happened to a similar effect again when animating the player; instead of making an animation for each direction, the tutorial taught us how to flip animations and save time and effort. Overall I feel more prepared to develop games in Godot after the tutorial, despite previous experience in the engine.
